  <h2>About myself</h2>
  <p>
  My names is Jose Juan Tapia, a PhD candidate working in Jim Faeder's lab in the Department of Computational and Systems Biology, University of Pittsburgh
  <br/><br/>
  My scientific interests include the theoretical aspects behind systems modeling, ranging from modeling algorithms to modeling informatics. In particular I've been involved
  in the development of spatial modeling frameworks) development of our flagship BioNetGen modeling suite, and my own Atomizer tool for the extraction
  of modeling assumptions.
  
  At the same time I'm also interested in all things programming, high performance computing, software design and architecture, and others.
