<h2>
Download Source</h2>

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/RuleWorld/atomizer/
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>libsbml, networkx (for state transition diagram creation), pexpect (for post atomization analysis). Check requirements.txt for specific versions of the libraries that Atomizer needs. You can also install all requirements with one command by doing</p>

{% highlight bash %}
pip install -r requirements.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p>From the atomizer root directory </p>

<h2>
<a id="Compile a binary" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation:</h2>

This step is optional since you can now run atomizer from the sbmlTranslator python script, however you can also compile a distributable binary version of the tool using the commands

{% highlight bash %}
make; make install
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This will place an executable called sbmlTranslator inside a bin directory located at the top level.</p>
